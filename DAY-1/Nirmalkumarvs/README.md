# DAY 1

The training starts with the rules of the training like coming on 
time, and problem-solving etc. Then our mentor shared some rules 
for developing a project. Then he gave a 
problem of line length calculation, we have to do it with 
the rules that were stated. As I have some previous experience 
in Java language, I don’t feel difficult in creating classes, 
but it is new for me to do test, but it is not that much 
difficult to under testing, but I don’t know
that much previous experience in GitHub. 
But I manged and learned to push the project to GitHub and 
to how to make commits, and how to see the commit logs.

I don’t know about readme file, but I learned how its 
structure to be.I learned how gradle differs from 
maven, not so deep but some basic thing, but I feel like if 
duration of code cycle is larger They can we finish the project without any error.

Our mentor was good, he didn’t pressure us in doing the 
projects quickly, I like his way of handling the class, 
The environment didn’t fear us to do something instead it 
help us and teach us the lesson from our mistakes like.
simply the first day creates a confidence in me.

During type racer my average typing speed was 34 wpm, 
I can write code faster because it is in my mind and 
syntax were used to me. But seeing the screen and 
typing takes some time for me, maybe I should learn touch typing.
so I’ll try to learn touch typing faster.

There is no feedback from me may be it
would be nice as like today if there is no such 
pressure on us, which make everyone to enjoy the work.
